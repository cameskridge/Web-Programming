<p>After losing the Defensive Player of The Year award to Aaron Donald, he simply posted a picture of the Jordan Meme captioned "And I took that personally." His brother also went to his defense: <br><br>

Aaron Donald is an absolutely incredible player. I love watching him play &amp; he’s headed to the Hall of Fame without question. This has nothing to do with AD personally. This is me saying what my brother won’t. TJ played 1 less game and STILL led the NFL in every major category. https://t.co/m1vzrD88WU<br><br>

Here are their numbers:<br><br>

Aaron Donald: 16 games, 45 combined tackles, 13.5 sacks, 4 forced fumbles, 1 pass deflection, 1 fumble recovery
T.J. Watt: 15 games, 53 combined tackles, 15 sacks, 7 pass deflections, 2 forced fumbles, 1 interception<br><br>

Keep in mind, Donald is a defensive tackle whereas Watt is a blitzing linebacker. With that in mind, Donald's numbers are harder to come by considering at least one lineman is right in his face on every place.
