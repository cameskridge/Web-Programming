Point 1: The St. Lunatics was originally a high school group that consisted of three members, and Ali was not one of them. Ali was a manager and a rapper in another duo.<br><br>

“There’s three people in this group that’s been a Lunatic since day one; Nelly, Kyjuan, and City [Spud],” Nelly shared. “We all went to school together. Alright? Cool. When we first started the Lunatics, Ali was not in this group. Stop me when I’m lying.”<br><br>

Point 2: Ali joined the group after a Jive showcase when music executives asked to hear more music from the three teens. Ali had performed with another person and joined the Lunatics hoping to get closer to his dreams to be a rap star. The four agreed to work with a production company called D2, which required them to sign 100% of their publishing. <br><br>

Nelly did not sign at first but was forced to do so or be kicked off the single they wanted to shop. The other members, including the ones who were his schoolmates, signed and Ali was the person pushing for them to do so. He also was the lead vocalist on the song.<br><br>

Point 3. The music with Ali as the lead did not get any traction.<br><br>

Point 4. After meeting Mase’s manager Cudda, the group started to work in New York in an effort to land the group a deal. According to Nelly, the music vet believed that the one with the most star potential was Nelly, not Ali. <br><br>

Cudda got Nelly a deal, not the others.<br><br>

Point 5. Despite getting the solo deal with Universal, Nelly negotiated in his contract that all of the members of the group get their own record contracts and in a radical reversal of power, the group gets to record together. <br><br>

Point 6. Nelly’s solo project, Country Grammar, has sold close to 20 million copies since its release. Murphy Lee’s solo project, Murphy’s Law, went gold. Ali’s solo project, Boughetto, went double wood.<br><br> 

Point 7. Nelly bought back his publishing from D2 (the deal that Ali made him sign in order to stay in the group) for $75,000 before Country Grammar blew up. The others did not and still do not own their own publishing. Nelly implies that the reason why their names were not on the albums was that they didn’t want to give D2 money off the record.<br><br>

“When they said the Lunatics was doing all the legwork and talent shows and all of that, that was us. He didn’t do that,” The “Hot in Herrre” rapper informed. “When we was going around town making a name for ourselves, doing the car wash, performing at the talent shows at [colleges]—that was us, that wasn’t Ali. Ali did not perform with us. Either he thought he was too good or he didn’t perform with us. … Just factuals. Actual factuals.”<br><br>

But Ali still maintains that his “actual factuals” are lies. He posted on his Instagram:<br><br>

“Nelly Would Create the Lie .. then 20yrs later blame us, and try and embarrass us like it was our idea!! … I’m going clear my name and show you EVERY LIE that he put on us !!!….Oh yeah, Good afternoon and enjoy your day !!”<br><br>

He even maintains that he started the group.<br><br>

“The St. Lunatics was a group that I started …my goal wasn’t to be in the group…I just was their Teacher… Now 1 student has moved to HOLLYWOOD and chose a life style that doesn’t allow him to remember things as well as others!🤷🏽‍♂️<br><br>

 Nelly: “Ali was the manager; he wasn’t putting in all the leg work … Ali wasn’t performing with us !! I don’t know why “maybe he thought he was better than us” (see that part was the DEVIL )<br><br>

 Murphy Lee: “Ali started off as the manager…….He was still training us (teaching).. he didn’t want us to perform , he wasn’t ready to present the product.”<br><br>
