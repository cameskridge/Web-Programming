    Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant may be forced to miss more games because of the NBA's COVID-19 protocols.<br><br>

Per ESPN's Malika Andrews and Adrian Wojnarowski, Durant won't travel with the team for Saturday's game at the Philadelphia 76ers and could miss "multiple games" while undergoing contact tracing.<br><br>

Durant was scratched from the starting lineup shortly before tipoff of Friday's 123-117 loss to the Toronto Raptors, but he was cleared to enter the game in the first quarter.<br><br>

After playing 19 minutes, Durant was told he had to leave the bench area.<br><br>

NBA spokesman Tim Frank said in a statement that Durant had close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19:<br><br>

"Under the league's health and safety protocols, we do not require a player to be quarantined until a close contact has a confirmed positive test. During the game, a positive result was returned for the person Durant interacted with. ... Once that test was confirmed positive, out of an abundance of caution, Durant was removed from the game."<br><br>

Frank noted Durant returned three negative tests in the past 24 hours, "including two negative PCR tests Friday."<br><br>

Per NBA protocols, contact tracing "may require players and team staff to undergo five consecutive days of twice-a-day lab-based testing, in addition to daily point-of-care tests," per Wojnarowski and Tim Bontemps.<br><br>

Durant missed three straight games from Jan. 5-8 because of COVID-19 protocols. The Nets have a road game against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday before they host the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday.<br><br>
