Unless you’re a casual, you know about Christian Wood. Poached from Detroit last offseason (where he was impressive after the Drummond trade), he is averaging 22 points and 10.1 rebounds a game, shooting 55.8% overall, and he has to be respected from three (42.1% on 4.5 attempts a game). He is one of the reasons Houston has surged since trading away James Harden.<br><br>

Now it appears Houston will have to be without Wood for a while.<br><br>

Wood stepped on the foot of Ja Morant and had a nasty ankle sprain on Thursday night. This is the second time he sprained the same ankle this season, the first time he missed three games. This appeared much worse as he had to be helped off the court and eventually put in a wheelchair to get to the locker room.<br><br>

The Rockets announced that Woods has a right ankle sprain and will be evaluated week-to-week, which is often code for him missing an extended period of time.<br><br>

No Wood because of the ankle sprain will mean a lot more DeMarcus Cousins, he’ll get all the run he can handle.<br><br>

The Rockets have won 7-of-8 and surged up to 11-10 and 10th place in the West. Houston wants to climb that ladder and get in a better play-in position, but that just got harder without wood for a while.<br><br>
