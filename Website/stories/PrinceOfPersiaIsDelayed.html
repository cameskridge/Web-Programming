<p>Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake has been delayed to an unspecified date in the future. It was previously slated to launch in March. This is the game's second public delay, as the game was originally slated to arrive in January.<br><br>

"Since announcing Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake in September, we saw an outpouring of feedback from you on this beloved franchise," reads a line from the developer's announcement of the delay. "It is your passion and support that is driving our development teams to make the best game possible. We that said, we have made the decision to shift the release for Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake to a later date. This extra development time will enable our teams to deliver a remake that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original."<br><br>
"We understand the update might come as a surprise and we will continue to keep you posted on progress of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake. In the meantime, we want to thank you all for your ongoing support."<br><br>

In addition to the overhauled visuals, game director Pierre-Sylvain Gires says camera and combat have been improved in the remake. In particular, the developers have added a targeting system to the game, which according to Gires "enhanced the velocity of the Prince and his abilities to do amazing moves."<br><br>

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time originally released for PS2, Xbox, and GameCube back in 2003. The game was met with widespread critical acclaim at the time. GameSpot scored it 9/10 in our original Sands of Time review. "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a game that can be recommended wholeheartedly," we wrote. "It looks fantastic and features responsive controls, some original play mechanics, a good story, and plenty of thrilling adventure. In simplest terms: Do not miss out on this game."<br><br>

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake is coming to PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The game will retail for $40 USD and includes the original 1989 Prince of Persia as an unlockable bonus. Those who pre-order the Sands of Time Remake will also receive the "Back to the Origins" bonus set, which comes with the following items:<br><br>

    The Original Prince outfit from The Sands of Time
    The Prince's Original Weapons set
    A Classic Filter that changes the screen to feel "as if players were playing the game back in time"<br><br>
