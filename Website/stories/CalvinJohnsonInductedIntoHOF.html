    Teams: Detroit Lions (2007-15)<br><br>

    Accolades: Six-time Pro Bowler; three-time All-Pro <br><br>

               

    Calvin Johnson's career totals don't jump off the page in a Hall of Fame context. The 35-year-old is 47th in receptions (731), 32nd in receiving yards (11,619) and 23rd in touchdown receptions (83).<br><br>

    Looking at his overall numbers only tells part of the story, though.<br><br>

    Johnson only spent nine seasons in the league, abruptly walking away during the 2016 offseason. The Detroit Lions' futility was a factor in his decision, as was the general wear and tear he had put on his body.<br><br>

    Make no mistake, Megatron was a HOF-caliber wideout. He twice led the NFL in receiving yards, and his 86.1 yards per game rank second behind Atlanta Falcons star Julio Jones.<br><br>

    Johnson isn't a direct parallel to Barry Sanders because Sanders retired within striking distance of Walter Payton's all-time rushing record. His standing among the greats wasn't in doubt.<br><br>

    In the case of both players, though, Lions fans were left to wonder what might have been if the front office had assembled a better roster around the offensive dynamos.<br><br>
