  Video footage of country star Morgan Wallen saying the N-word was leaked earlier this week. Despite the initial backlash, his record sales have increased since the video footage was released.<br><br>

Wallen's neighbor filmed the singer arriving home after a night out with friends. In the video, he's heard yelling, "Take care of this p**** a** n*****."<br><br>

He immediately apologized once the video was released to the public, but the singer suffered a backlash from multiple areas. Wallen's music was yanked from iHeartRadio, SiriusXM, Emmis Communications, Cumulus Media, and Country Music Television. Also, Republic Records and Big Loud Records announced that they were suspending his contract indefinitely and the Academy of Country Music ruled him ineligible for any awards.<br><br>

However, Billboard reports that Wallen's record sales have increased despite the lack of airplay. According to MRC Data, his album sales increased 339% between Feb. 2 and Feb. 3. His most recent album, Dangerous: The Double Album, enjoyed a 511% increase during the same time span and remains the number one album in the country.<br><br>

In addition, Wallen's top five-selling tracks that experienced a sales increase between Feb. 2 and Feb. 3 were: "More Than My Hometown" (453% increase); "Wasted on You" (80% increase); "Sand in My Boots" (162% increase); "7 Summers" (257% increase); and "Whiskey Glasses" (656% increase).<br><br>

After Wallen was exposed for using the racial slur, he apologized by stating, "I'm embarrassed and sorry. I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back. There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologize for using the word. I promise to do better."<br><br>
