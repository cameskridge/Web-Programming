  AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT is the upcoming graphics card based on AMD RDNA2 architecture. The graphics card will offer competitive performance in the upper mid-range space currently occupied by GA104 and GA106 GPUs. AMD intends to push for higher memory capacity compared to the NVIDIA offering. In fact, for this very reason, NVIDIA will launch GeForce RTX 3060 with 12GB of memory, despite launching a higher-end model with 8GB earlier.<br><br>
  It is now expected that AMD will unveil its Radeon RX 6700 XT in late Q1, possibly in March. Board partners do not have any date yet, but it is true that they are already actively developing the new SKU. It appears to be certain that RX 6700 XT will debut with 12GB GDDR6 memory across a 192-bit bus. The graphics card is also expected to offer a full Navi 22 GPU with 2560 Stream Processors. At this moment it is unclear when AMD will launch its non-XT model, but it would almost certainly offer fewer cores.<br><br>

We have also been told that AMD is now offering two Navi 22 XT GPUs to AIBs, one being strictly for overclocked models. However, details on those GPUs are still limited so we will be reaching out to our sources for clarification and more details. <br><br>

Meanwhile, the logo of the RX 6700 XT series, either from marketing materials or from product packaging guidelines that are now being distributed to AIBs, has been leaked by Andreas Schilling from HardwareLuxx. According to him, the graphics card will be targeted at 1440p gaming and will indeed come with 12GB of GDDR6 memory.<br><br>

Although Andreas does not appear to have a confirmation on a launch date, earlier rumors have suggested that AMD may announce Radeon RX 6700 XT series by end of March. However, announcing, releasing, and making products available are completely different terms, especially under current circumstances where no graphics card appears to be in stock.<br><br>
