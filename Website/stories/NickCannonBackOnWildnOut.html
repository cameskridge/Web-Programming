Having patched things up with ViacomCBS, Hollywood mogul/rapper Nick Cannon will resume his role as host and star of “Wild ‘N Out,” the popular improv comedy show. Some of the biggest names in hip-hop have appeared on “Wild ‘N Out,” and the show has launched a number of comedians’ careers to the next level.<br><br>

    “I want to assure my Jewish friends, new and old, that this is only the beginning of my education — I am committed to deeper connections, more profound learning and strengthening the bond between our two cultures today and every day going forward.” (Nick Cannon)<br><br>
