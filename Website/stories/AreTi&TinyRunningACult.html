  The T.I. and Tiny sex cult allegations have just taken an interesting turn. <br><br>

Right when you thought that the “Whatever You Want” rapper’s word would be the final say on the sex trafficking and abuse allegations that came up against him and his wife Tiny, Lisa Bloom has slithered into the picture. <br><br>

The celebrity lawyer, known for bringing down big stars for big paydays, went to her Instagram to announce that she will be taking over as legal counsel for an unnamed “victim.”<br><br>

She captioned the following, “Investigating T.I. on behalf of our new client. We stand with her. If you have information about T.I. please contact me via my law firm website, TheBloomFirm.com, or DM me. Free and confidential. Help us get to the truth.”<br><br>

 “I have said this for a long time: the music industry is long overdue for a reckoning on how women, especially Black women, are demeaned and abused,” Lisa Bloom continued. “Enough is enough.”<br><br>
